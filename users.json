On the front end, I craft engaging and responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love creating seamless and visually appealing experiences for users.Moving to the back end, I'm all about server-side logic and database management. Whether it's handling requests, processing data, or managing the application's business logic, I enjoy building the backbone of applications. I work with languages like Node.js and Python, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB",
